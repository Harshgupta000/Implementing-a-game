# Implementing a game
 This includes verilog code where we are implementing a game with certain rules and we are deciding the winner of the game for each round.

 # Description of game
 There will be total three rounds to decide the winner, the player 
who wins two or more of them will be the winner. In each round, a 
number “n” will be given, and they have to subtract the highest 
power of 2 less than the number. They will play alternatively; the 
player unable to do it will lose the game.
